## 🧹 Cleanup Recommendations

Based on analysis of the codebase, the following items should be addressed in future updates:

### Files to Remove
- `.DS_Store` files (macOS system files)
- Empty directories:
  - `.github/workflows`
  - `src/models`
  - `src/components/ui`
  - `src/components/common`
  - `src/lib`
  - Various empty directories in `functions/server`

### Code Cleanup
- Remove `console.log` statements from production code (found in 26 files)
- Address TODO comments in:
  - `src/components/auth/PrivateRoute.tsx`
  - `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`
  - `src/components/hr/HRDashboard.tsx`

### Potential Redundancies
- Duplicate components:
  - `src/components/dashboard/ActivityMonitor.tsx` and `src/components/dashboard/ActivityMonitor.new.tsx`
  - `src/components/schedule/AgentScheduleView.tsx` and `src/components/dashboard/AgentScheduleView.tsx`
- Multiple theme files:
  - `src/theme/theme.ts` and `src/theme/theme.tsx`

### Unused Files
- `prisma/schema.prisma` (if not using Prisma for database access)
- Scripts that may no longer be needed after initial setup:
  - Various migration scripts in `src/scripts/`
  - `scripts/createAdminUser.js`

## 🔜 Next Steps

For the next release cycle, consider:

1. **Code Cleanup**: Address the cleanup recommendations above
2. **Performance Optimization**: Implement code splitting and lazy loading
3. **Testing**: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
4. **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect current state
5. **Feature Enhancements**: Based on user feedback from v0.1
