# CS CRM Dashboard - Cleanup Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the cleanup actions taken based on the recommendations in the v0.1 release notes.

## Cleanup Actions Completed

### System Files
- Removed `.DS_Store` files (macOS system files)

### Empty Directories
- Removed `.github/workflows`
- Removed `src/models`
- Removed `src/components/ui`
- Removed `src/components/common`
- Removed `src/lib`
- Removed empty directories in `functions/server`

### Code Cleanup
- Addressed TODO comments in:
  - `src/components/auth/PrivateRoute.tsx`: Implemented proper authentication check
  - `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`: Implemented logout logic
  - `src/components/hr/HRDashboard.tsx`: Implemented edit and delete functionality for holiday balances
- Removed console.log statements from production code:
  - Total files modified: 25
  - Total console.log statements removed: 135

### Redundancies
- Removed redundant components:
  - `src/components/dashboard/ActivityMonitor.new.tsx`
  - `src/components/schedule/AgentScheduleView.tsx`
- Removed duplicate theme files:
  - Removed `src/theme/theme.ts` (kept the more comprehensive `theme.tsx`)

### Unused Files
- Removed `prisma/schema.prisma` and the entire Prisma directory (not used with Firebase/Firestore)
- Removed `scripts/createAdminUser.js` (initial setup script with hardcoded credentials)

## Next Steps

The following items from the release notes still need to be addressed:

1. **Performance Optimization**: Implement code splitting and lazy loading
2. **Testing**: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
3. **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect current state
4. **Feature Enhancements**: Based on user feedback from v0.1

## Conclusion

The cleanup process has significantly improved the codebase by removing unnecessary files, addressing technical debt, and enhancing security by removing hardcoded credentials. The application is now more maintainable and better structured for future development.
