# HR User Access Changes

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to simplify HR user access in the CRM Dashboard application. The goal was to streamline the HR section by consolidating all HR functionality into a single HR Dashboard page, removing redundant navigation items and routes.

## Changes Made

### 1. Sidebar Navigation

- Simplified the HR navigation menu by removing the following items:
  - Employee Management
  - Leave Management
  - Performance Reviews
- Kept only the main "HR Dashboard" menu item for HR users

### 2. Route Structure

- Removed the following routes:
  - `/hr/employees`
  - `/hr/leave`
  - `/hr/performance`
- Maintained only the main HR Dashboard route (`/hr`)

### 3. Component Usage

- Consolidated all HR functionality into the main `HRDashboard.tsx` component
- Removed imports for unused HR components in `App.tsx`

## Rationale

The changes were made for the following reasons:

1. **Redundancy Elimination**: The HR Dashboard already included all the necessary functionality, making separate pages redundant.
2. **Simplified Navigation**: HR users now have a cleaner, more focused navigation experience.
3. **Maintenance Efficiency**: Consolidating functionality into a single component makes the codebase easier to maintain.
4. **Consistent User Experience**: HR users now have access to all their tools in one centralized location.

## HR Dashboard Functionality

The HR Dashboard component now serves as a comprehensive hub for all HR-related activities, including:

- Document management (signed documents)
- Payslip management
- Contract management
- Leave management

All these functions are organized into tabs within the HR Dashboard, providing a clean and efficient interface for HR users.

## User Access

- **Regular Users**: Have access to the standard dashboard, schedule, knowledge base, etc.
- **HR Users**: Have all the access of regular users, plus access to the HR Dashboard. HR users do not have access to the Manager Dashboard and will not see it in the sidebar navigation.
- **Admin Users**: Have all the access of HR users, plus access to admin-specific features and the Manager Dashboard.

This hierarchical access structure ensures that users have the appropriate level of access based on their role in the organization.
